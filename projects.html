<h2>Band Page</h2>
<p>Recently I created the website for a Denton based band looking to not spend too much cash. So instead of buying hosting and using a cms,
I decided to create their site with Github Pages. I did this because they wouldn't necesarily need access to the site regularly; 
All they would ever need to add were tour dates and photos and I took care of tour dates by linking up SongKick's website widget and
temporarily added a menu item to link people to their instagram account. Later on I may add a gallery but they said they don't really
have any good photos. Aside from that, the website is basically two pages; one index that doubles to include tour dates and an about pages
that doubles as a contact page. Aside from that, I made a menu that includes their music (link to soundcloud), photos (to instagram), and
lastly a donation button that links to give.to which is a new service I found. Later on they may need another button for merch but I'll deal
with that when we get there.
