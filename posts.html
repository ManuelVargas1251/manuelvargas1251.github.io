<h3>Band Page Using Github Pages</h3>
<h4>10/23/2015</h4> 
<p>Recently I created the website for a Denton based band looking to not spend too much cash. So instead of buying hosting and using a cms,
I decided to create their site with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. I did this because they wouldn't
necesarily need access to the site regularly for anything; All they would ever need to add were tour dates or photos and
I took care of tour dates by linking up SongKick's website widget to show tour dates and added a menu item to link people to
their instagram account. Later on I may add a gallery but they said they don't really have any good photos as of yet. Aside
from that, the website is basically two pages; one index that doubles to include tour dates and an about page that doubles as
a contact page. Aside from that, I made a menu that includes their music (link to soundcloud), photos (to instagram), and
lastly a donation button that links to give.to which is a new service I found.</p>
<p>
For the actual website, I found a template online on how to make a responsive background because I wanted the site to look as
good as it did on the computer, if not better on mobile. And so after doing some research I found the key code and imported
those files into my repository to commit. The biggest downside of using github is having to wait for your changes to load;
sometimes I didn't know if the change had happened yet. The other downside of Github is that I haven't figured out how to
upload photos directly into the repository using gitbash. I plan to learn this next time around but I found a work around
where you can upload your images when you create an issue and just grab the url. After all that, it was all just my own
customization to the original template (which I give credit to in the source code). The background image I made in photoshop
from a building I took a picture of while I was in Paris, France. The font was chosen by the band. I tried to import the font
onto the website but I guess that was a little too advance for me because I couldn't figure it out. Instead I just used
a tranparent png file.
